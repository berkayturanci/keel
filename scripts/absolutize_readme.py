"""Rewrite README relative links and images to absolute GitHub URLs, for PyPI.

Publish-only. `pyproject.toml` uses `README.md` as the PyPI long description, but
PyPI's `readme_renderer` cannot resolve a relative `](docs/…)` href or a relative
`<img src="docs/…">`: every in-repo link 404s and the hero image breaks. So the
publish workflow runs this against the working-tree README right before
`python -m build`, and never commits the result — the committed README stays
relative so GitHub renders it and `tests/test_docs_links.py` resolves it on disk.

What it rewrites (only outside fenced code blocks):

- relative Markdown links   `[text](docs/…)`        → `…/blob/main/docs/…`
  (a trailing-slash target → `…/tree/main/…`; any `#anchor` is preserved)
- relative reference defs   `[label]: docs/…`        → the same, title preserved
- relative Markdown images  `![alt](docs/…)`         → `raw.githubusercontent.com/…/main/docs/…`
- relative HTML `href`      `<a href="docs/…">`      → `…/blob/main/docs/…`
- relative HTML `src`/`srcset` (the hero `<picture>`) → the same raw host,
  every candidate in a multi-candidate `srcset`, not just the first

Left untouched: anything carrying a URL scheme (`https:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`,
`data:`, `ftp:`…), a protocol-relative `//host/…` target, and same-page
`#anchors`. The old guard named only `https?://`, `#` and `mailto:`, so a
future `[x](tel:…)` or `<img src="data:…">` would have been rewritten into
`…/blob/main/tel:…` — and the real-README guard would not have caught it,
because the mangled target still starts with `https://` (#1261).

The transform is deterministic and idempotent (a second run is a no-op), so the
reproducible-build rebuild in `publish.yml` sees the same bytes and digests match.

`scripts/` is maintenance tooling outside the coverage gate;
`tests/test_absolutize_readme.py` is what holds this.
