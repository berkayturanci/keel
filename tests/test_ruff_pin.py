"""CI and the pre-commit hook must format with the same ruff.

Two versions of a formatter are two formatters, and this repository nearly
shipped that: #966 formatted the tree with ruff 0.16.3 while #918 had already
moved the hook to 0.16.4. They happened to agree on this tree — checked, not
assumed — but nothing would have said so, and the next pair might not.

CI now gates on `ruff format --check`, which makes the version a contract
rather than a detail: if CI's ruff and the hook's ruff drift apart, the gate
starts refusing exactly the output the hook produces.

The version is deliberately **pinned** on both sides rather than floated. The
dev extra is an unpinned `ruff`, which is right for linting — new rules are worth
picking up — but a format gate on a floating formatter goes red the day ruff
changes its style, for reasons that have nothing to do with the change under
review. That is the failure mode that teaches people to re-run rather than
read.
