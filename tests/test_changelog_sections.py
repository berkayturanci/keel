"""A release section may appear at most once per version.

Written after `## [1.12.0]`, `## [1.10.0]` and `## [1.6.4]` were each found to
repeat a section — shipped that way across seven releases. Every entry was
correct and none was lost; they were simply inserted above the previous top
section each time, so those blocks grew alternating headings.

It matters at release time rather than while editing: `## [Unreleased]` becomes
`## [x.y.z]` verbatim, so a duplicated heading ships to PyPI and to the GitHub
Release notes, where a reader looking for "what changed" finds two lists and no
reason to think either is complete.

Cheap to detect, invisible to review — a reviewer sees the diff hunk, not the
shape of the whole section.
