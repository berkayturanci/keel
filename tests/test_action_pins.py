"""Pinned GitHub Action SHAs must match the version they claim to be (issue #784).

Pinning by SHA is the security control; the ``# vX.Y.Z`` beside it is how a
reviewer decides whether that SHA is worth trusting. When the two disagree the
annotation is worse than absent, because it invites a check it cannot support.

This repo kept 32 pins correct by discipline alone — and then the two CI jobs
added in #778 and #780 used bare ``@v4``/``@v5`` refs, which is how #783 came to
propose bumping them to ``@v7`` while leaving them unpinned. Discipline held
until the moment it did not, and nothing noticed.

The offline cases check shape, because a malformed pin is a defect anywhere. The
online case resolves each comment against the upstream tag, needs the network,
and runs only when ``KEEL_CHECK_EXTERNAL=1`` — the same opt-in the other
compare-against-the-world checks use, so the default suite stays hermetic.
